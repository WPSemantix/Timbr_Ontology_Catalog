# Higher Education Model

## Overview
The Higher Education Model is designed to represent the core components and activities involved in managing academic institutions, such as universities and colleges. This model helps institutions manage data related to courses, students, faculty, research, and more. By organizing and structuring key educational concepts, this model enables better management of academic resources, student life, and institutional operations.

## Key Concepts

- **Student**: Tracks the students enrolled in courses and programs.
- **Faculty**: Represents the academic staff, including professors and lecturers.
- **Research Project**: Tracks the research initiatives undertaken by students and faculty.
- **Enrollment**: Manages the enrollment of students in courses and programs.
