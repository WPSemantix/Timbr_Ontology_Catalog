# FIBO Model

## Overview
The FIBO (Financial Industry Business Ontology) Model is designed to represent complex financial concepts and relationships. This model organizes and standardizes data related to financial agreements, institutions, securities, and other key financial instruments, facilitating data interoperability and clarity in financial communications and operations.

By capturing core concepts such as `Agreement`, `Account`, `Capital`, and `Ownership`, the FIBO Model enables organizations to better manage financial data and ensure compliance with financial standards.

## Key Concepts
- **Agreement**: Represents legal or contractual agreements within the financial industry.
- **Ownership and Control**: Captures the relationships regarding ownership and management of financial assets.
- **Account**: Represents accounts held by institutions or individuals within financial systems.
- **Capital**: Tracks financial capital and investments.
- **Equity**: Represents ownership interest in financial entities.
