# Asset Management Model

## Overview
The Asset Management Model is designed to help organizations effectively track and manage their physical and digital assets. By organizing data about assets, such as their locations, inventory status, and maintenance schedules, this model provides a clear structure for managing assets throughout their lifecycle. It connects core concepts like `Asset`, `Inventory`, and `Location` with related elements such as `Maintenance Schedules`, `Technicians`, and `Vendors`, ensuring that assets are well-maintained, properly allocated, and available when needed.

## Key Concepts
- **Asset**: The items being tracked, which can be either physical (like equipment) or digital (like software).
- **Inventory**: Details the quantity of assets available and their types.
- **Location**: Tracks where assets are physically located or assigned.
- **Maintenance Schedule**: Keeps track of when and how often assets need to be serviced.
- **Part**: Represents individual components that are part of an asset.
- **Technician**: Refers to the people responsible for maintaining and repairing assets.
- **Vendor**: Represents external providers of assets or maintenance services.
- **Work Order**: Specific tasks assigned to technicians or vendors for maintenance or other services related to assets.
