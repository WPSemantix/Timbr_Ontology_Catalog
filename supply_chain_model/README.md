# Supply Chain Model

## Overview
The Supply Chain Model represents the key elements and relationships across orders, products, materials, shipments, plants, inventory, and customers. This model lets organizations analyze order flow, product mix, material costs, inventory, and shipping performance. It serves as a comprehensive framework for supply chain analytics and tracking end-to-end operations.

## Key Concepts
- **Order**: Commercial transactions with pricing, status, market, and dates.
- **Product**: Sellable items with category, department, and attributes.
- **Material**: Inputs used in products, including per-kg pricing and delivery times.
- **Shipment**: Delivery records with mode, dates, and late delivery risk.
- **Customer**: Buyers and segments connected to orders and shipments.
- **Inventory**: Stock locations, quantities, and product assignments.
- **Plant**: Production facilities and their shipped-to relationships.
- **Bill of Material**: Product composition with material ratios and quantities.
