# Telecommunications Model

## Overview
The Telecommunications Model represents the key elements and relationships within a telecom ecosystem, including customers, subscriptions, call records, devices, billing, and service usage. This model enables organizations to analyze churn, revenue, usage patterns, and customer experience across networks and products.

## Key Concepts
- **Customer**: Subscribers with demographics, accounts, and usage.
- **Subscription**: Active plans, start/end dates, and associated services.
- **Call Detail Record (CDR)**: Voice/data/SMS usage with timestamps, duration, and cost.
- **Device**: Mobile devices or equipment tied to customer subscriptions.
- **Billing**: Invoices, payments, charges, and revenue assurance.
- **Service**: Network or product offerings, including bundles and promotions.
- **Location**: Geographical regions for service usage and customer tracking.
