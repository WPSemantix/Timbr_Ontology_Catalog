# Clinical Trials Model

## Overview
The Clinical Trials Model is designed to support the management, tracking, and analysis of clinical trials. This model captures the essential elements involved in clinical trials, including studies, interventions, and outcomes, providing a structured framework to help organizations manage complex clinical trial data.

By organizing key concepts such as `Studies`, `Interventions`, and `Outcomes`, the model facilitates the exploration and analysis of clinical trial data, helping organizations ensure accurate tracking of trials from start to finish.

## Key Concepts
- **Studies**: Represents individual clinical trials being conducted.
- **Interventions**: Details the treatments or procedures that are part of the clinical trials.
- **Outcomes**: Tracks the results and effects observed during the trials.
- **Facilities**: Represents the locations where clinical trials are conducted.
