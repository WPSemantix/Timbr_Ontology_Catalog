# Customer 360 Model

## Overview
The Customer 360 Model is designed to help organizations achieve a comprehensive view of their customers by integrating data across various touchpoints. This model captures key elements such as customer transactions, churn risk, and account information to provide a holistic understanding of each customer’s interactions and potential behaviors. By leveraging this model, organizations can better predict customer churn, understand customer value, and improve customer retention strategies.

## Key Concepts
- **Customer**: Represents the individual customers whose data is being tracked.
- **Churn Prediction**: Uses customer data to predict the likelihood of a customer churning.
- **Account Transactions**: Tracks the transactions linked to a customer's account.
- **Churn Risk Rating**: Provides a risk score indicating the likelihood of a customer churning.
