# Automotive Model

## Overview
The Automotive Model is designed to help organizations within the automotive industry manage various facets of the business, from vehicle production to customer interaction and after-sales services. This model organizes data related to key automotive components such as assembly lines, vehicles, and sales, providing a comprehensive structure for managing and optimizing processes across the entire automotive lifecycle.

The model connects core concepts like `Vehicle`, `Production Order`, and `Sales Dealership`, ensuring that all aspects of automotive management are accounted for and can be easily tracked and analyzed.
