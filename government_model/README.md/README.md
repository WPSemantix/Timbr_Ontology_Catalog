# Government Model

## Overview
The Government Model is designed to represent the various components and activities involved in public administration and governance. This model helps governments manage data related to assets, budgets, regulations, elections, and more. By organizing and structuring key governmental concepts, the model enables better management of public resources, processes, and interactions with citizens.

## Key Concepts
- **Citizen**: Represents individuals within the jurisdiction of the government.
- **Budget**: Tracks the allocation of funds for various public projects and services.
- **Election**: Manages the data associated with the election process, candidates, and voting.
- **Public Works Project**: Represents government initiatives to build or maintain public infrastructure.
- **Service Request**: Tracks requests from citizens for government services or actions.
